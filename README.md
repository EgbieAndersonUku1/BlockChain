###What is a blockchain?
 
 __A blockchain,originally block chain is a list of records that are called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.
 Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data
  (generally represented as a merkle tree root_ hash)._ 
  


In this project I going to build a simple blockchain from the ground along with a
fancy GUI using flask. This blockchain will allow user to connect to mine blocks get rewards, create nodes and do 
everything a blockchain can.


###Todo
1. Create a database so the data are stored in a database rather than a text file
1. Build the user interface
1. Create the GUI
1. Create Nodes to different people to connect
