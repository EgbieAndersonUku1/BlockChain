1. Flask framework
1. Bootstrap
1. HTML, CSS

###What is a blockchain?
 
 __A blockchain is a list of records that are called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.
 Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data
  (generally represented as a merkle tree root_ hash)._ 
  


In this project I going to build a simple blockchain from the ground along with a
fancy GUI using flask. This blockchain will replicate everything a blockchain can do including allow user to connect 
to a series of nodes, mine blocks, get rewards, make transactions, etc.


###Todo
1. Create a database so the data are stored in a database rather than a text file
1. Build the user interface
1. Create the GUI
1. Create Nodes to different people to connect
